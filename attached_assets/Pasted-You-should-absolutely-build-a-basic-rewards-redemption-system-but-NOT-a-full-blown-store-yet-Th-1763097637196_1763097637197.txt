You should absolutely build a basic rewards / redemption system, but NOT a full-blown store yet.

The sweet spot is a lightweight, semi-manual redemption system that delivers real value, drives engagement, and doesn’t require complex fulfillment or expensive infrastructure.

🔥 MVP Approach (What I recommend you tell Replit to build)
1. A simple “Rewards Catalog” page with 4–5 placeholder items

Examples:

$5 Amazon / Kindle Gift Card – 500 points

Free ebook from a partnering author – 250 points

Club & Cover Badge Pack – 100 points

Feature your book to clubs for 48 hours – 750 points

Bonus points multiplier for a day – 300 points

These are super easy to support without involving shipping or complexity.

2. A “Redeem” button that creates a Redemption Request

Not a full checkout system — just a request.

A redemption request should create:

itemId

points spent

userId

timestamp

status: pending → approved → fulfilled

This keeps the system flexible and admin-controlled.

3. An Admin Dashboard page to approve rewards

You (as admin) can:

See pending reward requests

Approve or decline

Mark fulfilled

Add new rewards

This gives you full control while you’re still testing.

4. Deduct points from the user balance

When a user redeems an item:

Points immediately get deducted

If admin rejects the request → points refunded

This keeps the points system real and prevents exploitation.

5. Allow authors to contribute rewards

Super powerful:

An author can offer "5 free ebook copies for readers who redeem with 200 points”

This gets them more reviews

This creates value for users

Costs you nothing

The app just needs a flag for:

rewardType = author_contributed
copiesAvailable = X

✅ Why this approach is best for you right now
✔️ Minimal dev work

Replit can build this in a week.

✔️ No legal/tax/fulfillment complications

You aren’t storing or shipping items yourself.

✔️ Authors supply free rewards

You incentivize authors to participate without cost to you.

✔️ You get a working “store” that feels real

Users will see a catalog, spend points, redeem items, get value.

✔️ You can expand later

Once you’re growing, you can add:

Real gift card API

Automatic fulfillment

Premium digital items

In-app subscriptions

“Power-ups” for authors (boost their pitch visibility)

Club host tools purchasable with points (poll boosts, badges, etc.)
