Book Pitch — Full Synopsis
Overview

Book Pitch is a social marketplace and discovery platform that connects authors, book clubs, and readers through an engaging, gamified ecosystem. It blends the best parts of Goodreads, Substack, and Kickstarter — letting authors pitch their books to real readers and clubs, while readers and clubs earn points, badges, and rewards for participation and discovery.

At its core, Book Pitch is built around community, creativity, and credibility:

Authors showcase their work, get real feedback, and grow authentic audiences.

Book clubs find fresh reads, vote on pitches, and connect directly with emerging writers.

Readers join clubs or start their own, earn points for engagement, and shape what gets discovered next.

How It Works
1. Readers

Readers can join Book Pitch as individuals or by joining/creating a club. They can:

Browse book pitches from emerging and established authors.

Vote on which books their club should read next.

Chat in club discussion rooms.

Earn points and badges for reading, reviewing, and engaging in club activity.

Participate in book votes, polls, and challenges hosted by authors or Book Pitch itself.

Share their club’s activity on social media for extra points and recognition.

When a reader first joins, they are prompted to either:

Find a club that matches their interests (using filters like genre, frequency, style, or vibe).

Or start a new club, choosing details such as genres, meeting frequency, and co-hosts.

2. Book Clubs

Book clubs are the beating heart of the Book Pitch ecosystem. Clubs can:

Host members (readers) and designate a Host and optional Co-Host.

Set preferences for genre, pace, and number of books per month.

Have a Club Page that includes:

Club name, description, banner, and badges.

A message board / discussion feed.

Voting polls for upcoming reads.

A history of books completed and pitches reviewed.

A list of members and hosts, and possibly verified author guests.

Earn Club Badges for milestones such as “100 books completed” or “Author Collab Club.”

Earn Points for hosting authors, leaving reviews, or participating in reading challenges.

Clubs can also be featured or sponsored by authors looking to get exposure for their book.

3. Authors

Authors join Book Pitch to get their work discovered by real readers and clubs — not algorithms. They can:

Create Book Pitches, which include:

Title, synopsis, genre, and cover.

Formats available (ebook, paperback, audiobook, ARC, etc.)

Optional video pitch or trailer.

Download links or pre-order buttons.

Choose whether to join the AuthorSwap network — a community where authors trade books and provide verified reviews to each other.

View analytics showing:

How many clubs viewed or voted on their pitch.

Which genres or reader types engaged most.

Feedback, reviews, and engagement data.

Earn Author Points for verified reviews, completed swaps, or hosting Q&A sessions with clubs.

Authors can also sponsor featured listings or buy credits to reach more clubs (e.g., “Show my pitch to 50 mystery clubs this week”).
