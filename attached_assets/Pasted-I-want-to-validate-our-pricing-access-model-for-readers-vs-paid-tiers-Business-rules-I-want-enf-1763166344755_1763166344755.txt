I want to validate our pricing / access model for readers vs. paid tiers.

Business rules I want enforced:

Readers should always be free.

A user on the FREE tier should be able to:

Sign up and log in

Join public clubs

Request to join private clubs (if allowed)

Vote in polls

Read pitches and author profiles

Post messages in clubs

Earn points and redeem rewards (as long as they have points)

Paid packages should only affect:

Authors (PRO_AUTHOR, PUBLISHER)

Power club hosts (PRO_CLUB)

Credits / boosts

Please do the following in the codebase:

Identify all places where access is gated by tier/plan

Search for tier checks like PRO_AUTHOR, PRO_CLUB, PUBLISHER, FREE, etc.

List each feature or route that is restricted by tier.

Tell me: does any core reader action (join club, vote, read pitches, post in club) require a paid tier?

Confirm reader flows are NOT paywalled
Specifically confirm that a FREE user can:

Join a public club

Request to join a private club (if that’s how it’s designed)

Vote in a club poll

View club pages and messages

View public author profiles and pitches

Use the points shop if they have points

Confirm what PRO_CLUB actually unlocks

What features are ONLY available to PRO_CLUB that are not available to FREE users?

Is PRO_CLUB ever required just to participate in a club (vs. host/upgrade one)?

Confirm what PRO_AUTHOR and PUBLISHER unlock

What restrictions apply to FREE authors (pitch limits, boosts, analytics, etc.)?

What additional capabilities do PRO_AUTHOR and PUBLISHER get?

Make sure no reading/joining/voting actions are behind these tiers.

Report back in this format:

A. Free Reader Capabilities: List everything a FREE user can do and confirm there is no Stripe/tier check blocking them.

B. Paid Author Features: List features unlocked by PRO_AUTHOR and PUBLISHER.

C. Paid Club Host Features: List features unlocked by PRO_CLUB.

D. Any Conflicts: If you find any place where a reader’s normal behavior is paywalled or blocked based on tier, call it out and recommend a fix.

If possible, also suggest 2–3 automated tests we should add to guarantee that FREE users can always join clubs, vote, and read pitches without hitting a paywall.
