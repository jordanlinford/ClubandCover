Perfect—here’s a tight, copy-pasteable checklist you can give your Replit dev(s).
Each item has: Instruction (what to build/verify) + Ask Replit (confirmation questions + proof to show).

Book Pitch — Build/Verify Checklist for Replit
1) Environment & Core Setup

Instruction: Use Supabase (transaction pooler), Prisma, Fastify (or Next API routes), React/Vite. Configure .env, run migrations, seed minimal data.
Ask Replit:

Did you connect via the transaction pooler URL (port 6543)? Paste the redacted DSN pattern you used.

Run prisma migrate deploy output? Any pending migrations?

Show npm run dev logs with DB connection success.

Proof: screenshot of public.users and public.clubs tables populated (fake data OK).

2) Auth & Roles

Instruction: Supabase Auth with role on profile: reader | author | admin. Enforce role-based routing.
Ask Replit:

Can you create test users for each role and sign in/out?

Where is role stored (profiles.role)? Show the schema.

Proof: short screen capture switching accounts and seeing different nav options.

3) Database Schema (Prisma)

Instruction: Tables: users/profiles, clubs, memberships, pitches, votes, messages, badges, user_badges, points_ledger, author_swaps.
Ask Replit:

Paste the Prisma schema models for those tables (secrets removed).

Are all FKs indexed? Show the prisma migrate diff status.

Proof: run a seed and show row counts in each table.

4) Row-Level Security (RLS) / Access Control

Instruction: Enable RLS; policies so users only read/write what they should (e.g., club hosts manage their clubs).
Ask Replit:

List each policy by table (one line each) and its intent.

Can a non-member read a private club? (Should be no.)

Proof: Postman (or curl) calls showing forbidden vs allowed requests.

5) Onboarding Flow

Instruction: After signup, force user to choose Reader or Author; save role; route accordingly.
Ask Replit:

Does the first-run flow block access until a role is selected?

Proof: GIF of signup → role select → role-specific dashboard.

6) Club Creation & Membership

Instruction: Create club (name, description, genres, frequency, host/co-host). Join/leave club; membership stored.
Ask Replit:

Can a reader create a club and become hostId?

Where is co-host stored?

Proof: DB rows in clubs + memberships after create/join.

7) Club Search & Filters

Instruction: Search clubs by genre, keywords; paginate results.
Ask Replit:

Which endpoint handles search? Query params supported?

Is search case-insensitive and SQL-injection-safe?

Proof: 3 search queries showing different results + count/offset.

8) Club Room (Tabs)

Instruction: Club page with tabs: Info, Chat/Board, Voting, History/Completed.
Ask Replit:

Are tabs URL-addressable (e.g., ?tab=votes)?

Is membership enforced to read/post chat?

Proof: screen capture of each tab with sample data.

9) Club Chat / Message Board

Instruction: Simple message feed (messages table), newest first; anti-spam throttling (e.g., 1 msg/5s).
Ask Replit:

What validation prevents empty/oversized posts?

Is author ID + timestamp stored?

Proof: post a message, refresh, show persistence.

10) Voting System (Book Selection)

Instruction: Club creates a vote for upcoming pick; members cast 1 vote per poll; close poll, persist winner to club history.
Ask Replit:

How do you prevent duplicate voting? (unique constraint?)

How is a poll closed and winner recorded?

Proof: run a full poll cycle; show final winner saved to club_history.

11) Author Dashboard

Instruction: Author sees “My Pitches”, basic analytics (views, votes, saves).
Ask Replit:

Where do you compute analytics (view counters, vote totals)?

What’s the route to create/edit a pitch?

Proof: create a pitch; show it rendered and listed.

12) Book Pitches (CRUD + Media)

Instruction: Pitch includes title, cover, synopsis, genre tags, available formats, optional video link.
Ask Replit:

Validate required fields? Max lengths?

Where are images stored (Supabase Storage)?

Proof: upload cover; show URL served and displayed.

13) AuthorSwap (Phase 1 scaffold)

Instruction: Minimal scaffold: author can propose swap, accept/decline, mark completed.
Ask Replit:

What states exist? (proposed|accepted|declined|completed)

How do you ensure each side uploads a short proof/review note?

Proof: create → accept → complete flow with DB rows.

14) Points System (MVP)

Instruction: Write points_ledger entries for actions: join club, start club, vote, post message, create pitch, complete swap. Maintain profiles.points as sum.
Ask Replit:

Show the ledger insert code and the reducer that updates totals.

Is it idempotent (e.g., voting twice doesn’t double-count)?

Proof: perform actions; show ledger rows + updated total points.

15) Badges (MVP)

Instruction: Rule engine: earn badge when thresholds met (e.g., 10 votes = “Active Voter”). Store in user_badges.
Ask Replit:

Where are rules declared (config JSON/TS enum)?

When are checks run? (cron/hook after ledger write?)

Proof: give a user enough actions to trigger a badge; show badge on profile.

16) Social Sharing

Instruction: Public share pages for club (read-only) and pitch with Open Graph tags.
Ask Replit:

Do public pages hide private data and show OG tags?

Proof: link inspector (e.g., OG tags output) + a public pitch URL (with dummy data).

17) Admin Utilities

Instruction: Admin view to: view users/clubs/pitches, ban spam, close polls, revoke badges.
Ask Replit:

How do you gate admin (role check + RLS)?

Proof: admin screen capture performing a safe action (e.g., closing a poll in sandbox).

18) Error Handling & Telemetry

Instruction: Central error handler; toast/UI errors; basic logging.
Ask Replit:

Where do errors funnel (server + client)?

Proof: intentionally trigger a failed vote; show user-friendly error and server log.

19) Security & Validation

Instruction: Zod/Yup validation on inputs; file type checks for images; rate-limits on chat.
Ask Replit:

Show the validators; what limits exist for messages & uploads?

Proof: attempt invalid input; show rejection.

20) Stripe (Phase 2 Stub)

Instruction: Stub routes + UI for upcoming paid author features; feature flags off in prod.
Ask Replit:

Where is the flag? How do you toggle sandbox?

Proof: UI shows “Coming Soon” with disabled actions; server routes 403.

21) Build/Test Scripts

Instruction: npm run dev, npm run build, npm run test, npm run seed.
Ask Replit:

Share package.json scripts; do tests run in CI?

Proof: test run output (even if minimal).

22) Deployment Readiness

Instruction: Single command start; healthcheck route (/health), .env.example, README with setup steps.
Ask Replit:

What’s the healthcheck response?

Proof: README excerpt + .env.example screenshot (no secrets).
